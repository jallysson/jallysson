## Hi (:

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the Graduate Program in Information Systems at the School of Arts, Sciences, and Humanities at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (EACH-USP), and I am a graduate in Information Systems from Faculdade de Imperatriz - Wyden Facimp. With my research project in the area of Pattern Recognition using Machine Learning techniques for Natural Gesture problems, I have acquired skills in Python, Data Mining, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.

I have experience working with large-scale technologies such as Google BigQuery, Pyspark, and Apache Airflow, and I possess knowledge in Git, Github, SQL, and other cloud platforms such as Google Cloud Platform, AWS, and Azure DevOps.

I am interested in roles related to Software Engineering, Data Engineering, Machine Learning Engineering, or Data Science, where I can apply my skills and knowledge to solve complex problems and contribute to driving business success.
